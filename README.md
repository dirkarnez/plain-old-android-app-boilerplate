plain-old-android-app-boilerplate
=================================
plain-old android app is faster :)

### TODOs
- [ ] GitHub action

### Notes
- This is tested working and based on [Kolodez2106/HelloWorld-app-compiled-in-bash: This is a simple hello-world app for Android, compiled by command line tools.](https://github.com/Kolodez2106/HelloWorld-app-compiled-in-bash)
- Java 11+ is needed for setting up command line tools. However, after the setup, java 8 should be use to compile plain-old android app
